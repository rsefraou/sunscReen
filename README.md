# sunscReen
 
Package created by Charlotte Fleury, Astrid Wiedmer, Alexandre Schroeter and Rita Sefraoui Tahiri for a text mining project on sunscreen reviews analysis. The sentiments were selected from the nrc package but we added comfort and discomfort as well as words that are specific either to skin, to sunscreen, or to skincare. We also added words specific to reviews from MakeupAlley and comments from Reddit.
